These are (most of) the things I carry around in my backpack:

1. The gigantic 330W power adapter for my laptop and the bag for it
2. My Omen laptop, armed with an RTX 3070, as a result of which its battery can last not much more than an hour
3. A small power strip and the bag for it, a lifesaver in many situations (especially those invloving the laptop)
4. My water bottle, a lifesaver (literally)
5. The small bag for my mouse and other computer-related gadgets such as my mobile SSD
6. My mouse and mouse pad, necessay as the touchpad of the laptop became glitchy a year back
7. Lucas' Papaw Ointment, very effective as a first-aid medication for small wounds and bites
8. A medication for insect bites, quells itchiness very effectively
9. FengYouJing, an ointment with colling effects and a strong fragrance that reportedly drives off insects
10. My wallet, with some cash and bank card (its exact contents I wish to be kept confidential)
11. A folding umbrella, a lifesaver in other regions but probably not here
12. An airtag
13. Mints for refreshment
14. A very light jacket that can be folded and fit into a small pouch
15. A Casio FX-991-CN calculator. Fun fact: almost every student from Shanghai has one of these because it is required in the Chinese college entrance exam
16. A scissor, comes in handy (sometime unexpectedly)
17. A pen bag, for pens, pencils, and handy knickknacks such as a flash drive (and the scissor)
18. A large plastic bag. Very unexpectedly useful in many situations especially when you have a scissor
19. A high wattage charger
20. A small bag for storing all sorts of smaller electronic gadets such as the charger, the powerbank, and some cables
21. A 2000 mAh portable powerbank, absolutely necessary for travels
22. My backpack (Nearing the end of its life cycle, RIP)
