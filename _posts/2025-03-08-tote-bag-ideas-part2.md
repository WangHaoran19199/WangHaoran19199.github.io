1. A double-side printed bag, with half the face of an animal (or something else) on each side. It may not be obvious who the face belongs to when the bag is empty and only one side is shown, but when the bag is full and bulges, one can see both sides of the bag and see the face. Can also be used as silly head covering (haloween costume-ish)

2. The original knapsack problem: "Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."

    Tote bags are often used because they are far more environmentally-friendly than plastic bags as shopping bags. People also like them because it allows them to express their ideas.
    THE TOTE BAG PROBLEM branch1: "Given a set of slogans and icons, each with a size required for its printing and a level of importance to you, determine which to be printed on a tote bag so that the total size is less than or euqal to the size of the printable zone of this tote bag, and as much of your identity is expressed as possible." 
    THE TOTE BAG PROBLEM branch2: "You can only keep a fixed number of bags, with each bag being either a tote bag or a platic shopping bag. While tote bags are environmentally-friendly, you don't need that much of them, and plastic bags can be reused as trashbags. Determine how many tote bags and how many plastic bags you want to have."




    Disclaimer: these problems are for fun only, they are absolutely not meant to be satire against personal expression and environmental protection. I believe reducing plastic waste is a noble cause, and it is good for people to express themselves in all legal ways.
