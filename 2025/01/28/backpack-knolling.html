<p>These are (most of) the things I carry around in my backpack:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The gigantic 330W power adapter for my laptop and the bag for it</li>
  <li>My Omen laptop, armed with an RTX 3070, as a result of which its battery can last not much more than an hour</li>
  <li>A small power strip and the bag for it, a lifesaver in many situations (especially those invloving the laptop)</li>
  <li>My water bottle, a lifesaver (literally)</li>
  <li>The small bag for my mouse and other computer-related gadgets such as my mobile SSD</li>
  <li>My mouse and mouse pad, necessay as the touchpad of the laptop became glitchy a year back</li>
  <li>Lucasâ€™ Papaw Ointment, very effective as a first-aid medication for small wounds and bites</li>
  <li>A medication for insect bites, quells itchiness very effectively</li>
  <li>FengYouJing, an ointment with colling effects and a strong fragrance that reportedly drives off insects</li>
  <li>My wallet, with some cash and bank card (its exact contents I wish to be kept confidential)</li>
  <li>A folding umbrella, a lifesaver in other regions but probably not here</li>
  <li>An airtag</li>
  <li>Mints for refreshment</li>
  <li>A very light jacket that can be folded and fit into a small pouch</li>
  <li>A Casio FX-991-CN calculator. Fun fact: almost every student from Shanghai has one of these because it is required in the Chinese college entrance exam</li>
  <li>A scissor, comes in handy (sometime unexpectedly)</li>
  <li>A pen bag, for pens, pencils, and handy knickknacks such as a flash drive (and the scissor)</li>
  <li>A large plastic bag. Very unexpectedly useful in many situations especially when you have a scissor</li>
  <li>A high wattage charger</li>
  <li>A small bag for storing all sorts of smaller electronic gadets such as the charger, the powerbank, and some cables</li>
  <li>A 2000 mAh portable powerbank, absolutely necessary for travels</li>
  <li>My backpack (Nearing the end of its life cycle, RIP)</li>
</ol>
